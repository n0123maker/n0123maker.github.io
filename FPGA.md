# FPGA Programming

Time to dust off my old Terasic DE2-70 board. It features the Altera Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6N FPGA.

# Installation

The latest version of Quartus II which supports the Cyclone II seems to be v13.0.1.232 which can be downloaded from [Download Center for FPGAs](https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/13.0sp1/).

After installation it's time to install the USB-Blaster driver. Use the USB cable to connect the leftmost USB
connector on the DE2-70 board to a USB port on the computer. The correct driver can be found at location:
```
C:\altera\13.0sp1\quartus\drivers\usb-blaster
```
